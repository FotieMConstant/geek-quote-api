# geek-quote-api
An API for retrieving random geeky quotes

## Apps built on geek-quote-api

- <a href="https://mrtimeey.github.io/geek-quotes-app/">geek-quotes-app</a> by <a href="https://github.com/MrTimeey/">MrTimeey</a> 

## Production host
### ðŸš¨ Update 2023!
The production host which was initially hosted on heroku was moved to vercel due to the fact that heroku no longer supports free tier.

- Old domain: [https://geek-quote-api.herokuapp.com/v1/quote](https://geek-quote-api.herokuapp.com/v1/quote)(offline)
- New domain: [https://geek-quote-api.vercel.app/v1/quote](https://geek-quote-api.vercel.app//v1/quote)(online)

The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to `*` so that you can make requests from any domain.
